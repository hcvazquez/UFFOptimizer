# UFFOptimizer Benchmark

We selected 22 JS applications. Each selected application meet the following conditions:
* it must be open-source
* it can be used on the front-end
* test coverage of the functions of the application must be greater than 85\% 
* it must depend on at least one library
* it must have information about how to compile it and run the tests

The file "Results data.cvs" details the set of applications, their characteristics and findings.
"Results data.cvs" shows not only the direct libraries from which each application depends on but also the indirect dependencies that are generated by the direct dependencies (all the libraries resulting from these dependencies are  part of the bundle). For instance, while geojsonhint only  depends directly on 5 libraries, geojsonhint indirectly depends on 19 libraries. Thus, geojsonhint depends on a total of 24 libraries.

Another interesting information is the percentage of Lines of Code (LOC) from the bundle that belongs to dependent libraries. While the total number of LOC of all bundles is 335,819, a 158,695 of them belongs to dependent libraries (47.26%). Something similar happens with the number of functions. A total of 19,586 functions are defined in the bundles but 10,063 of them belong to libraries (51.38%). Thus, since the incidence of libraries in the bundle is large, it is important to analyze the functions that belong to dependent libraries with the goal of removing those functions being unnecessary. Also, "Results data.cvs" reports for each application the size of the minified bundle. If the application already had a minifier script, we used that minifier. If not, we used Uglify (http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).

Finally, "Results data.cvs" also contains the results of our approach. When instrumenting the source code and running the Dynamic UFF Detection activity, we found a total of 7,021 UFFs in the bundles. That is, 69.77% of the functions in the bundle that belong to dependent libraries are UFFs (35.85% of the total number of functions in the bundle). Moreover, these UFFs are responsible for a high number of lines of code of the bundle. Specifically, \UFFs represent a  54.35% of the LOC in the bundle that belongs to dependent modules (25.68% of the total number of LOC in the bundle).

### What is the percentage of UFFs in js applications? 
The percentages of UFFs in JS applications is in the range 14.69%-47.17%. Some of the applications are outliers such as *teoria* and *virtual-dom* that only report a 1.7% of UFFs. After manually analyzing their source code we found that the low percentage of UFFs is due to the fact that both applications depend on very few functions (*teoria* has in its bundle only 11 functions that belongs to dependencies and *virtual-dom* has only 8 functions). Moreover, we tested for a correlation between the percentage of functions in the bundle belonging to dependencies and the percentage of UFFs using the Pearson's correlation and we obtained a value of 0.91. Thus, the percentage of UFFs is directly correlated with the percentage of functions of depending libraries.  The greater the percentage of such functions in the bundle,  the greater the percentages of UFFs. This result seems to imply that the use of external libraries in JS applications increments the unused code, justifying the need of removing UFFs.

### How much can an application be reduced, if its \uffs are removed with our approach?
The applications are reduced in a media of 18% after applying our approach. "Results data.cvs" shows the results of our experiment. The  7,021 UFFs  were removed or emptied by our approach. Specifically, 30.5% of the UFFs (=2,142) are completely removed while the bodies of 69.5% of them (=4,879) are now empty. This procedure allows us to remove a total of 81,370 lines of code from the bundles. This corresponds to 94.34% of the source code identified as UFFs.
Some applications are above this range, such as the case of *Messy* that was reduced in a 66.17% while its percentage of UFFs was only 33.77%.  After carefully analyzing the bundle of *Messy* we found that the the reduction was due to the fact that the UFFs removed were, in general, long functions. Moreover, many of these functions are related with Chinese and Japanese character encoding that in some cases can take more bytes than regular characters. Also, to understand the relationship between the percentage of UFFs and the reduction in the minified bundle after removing them, we ran a Pearson's correlation test. We found that there exist a strong correlation of 0.86 between these factors. Thus, the greater the percentages of UFFs, the largest the bundle reductions. 

In order to assure that our removal strategy does not affect the behavior of the applications, we followed a two-step validation process. First, we re ran the tests of the application to check that they still passed. Second, we replaced the application optimized by our approach in third-party applications using that application. Our goal with the first validation was to conduct a sanity check to evaluate if the removal of UFFs does not produce compilation or execution errors. We conduct this process in the 22 applications and all the tests passed.

If the optimized application is intended to be used by third-party applications, those third-party applications could use some functions defined in a dependency of the optimized application. Along this line, the goal of our second step of the validation process is to analyze if third-party applications do not change their behavior after replacing the original application by the application optimized by our approach. This validation is challenging because for each optimized application we need to find several third-party applications that use the same version of the optimized application. Moreover, the third-party applications must have a high test coverage.  For this reason, we conducted this validation with 5  applications. "3party results.csv" shows the applications and the third-party applications that use them. After replacing the original library code with the optimized one we did not obtain errors on the tests.
However, an exception occurred when executing *unexpected-mitm* to test the reductions in *Messy*. The problem was that *Messy* uses the *underscore* library, thus, when analyzing *Messy* our approach removed UFFs from *underscore*. At the same time, *unexpected-mitm* also uses the *underscore* library. Therefore, some UFFs in *Messy* are not UFFs in *unexpected-mitm* and as a result an error occurred. However, what we want to prove is that *Messy* does not use those functions during its execution in the context of a library that depends on it. In this way we separate the underscore library during the test, using an optimized version  for messy and one without optimization for *unexpected-mitm*. Consequently, the tests are passing, showing that *Messy* does not use these functions in the context of *unexpected-mitm*.
